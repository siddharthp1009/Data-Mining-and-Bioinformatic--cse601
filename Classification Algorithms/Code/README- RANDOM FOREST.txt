// This is the READ ME File to RUN Random Forest

The code is a simple .py file and can be run in pycharm(RECOMMENDED) or any python interpreter

Step 1 : Run the code for RandomForest.py

Step 2 : The code will detect all text files for the algorithm and will print something like below;


		1 files detected for Random Forest
		['project3_dataset1.txt']
		working on file project3_dataset1.txt
----------------------------------------------------------------

	

Step 3 : Number of trees can be changed in line 352 and the random subspace(number of features) can be changed on line 206


NOTE : THE ALGORITHM TAKES SOME TIME TO RUN BEFORE IT CAN PRINT THE RESULTS FOR EACH FOLD.

Step 4: On Completion of above steps the result will be printed in the console for all folds with the final values for accuracy, precision, recall, f1-measure. The result will be displayed as below at the end of the algorithm:



----------- FINAL METRICS -----------
Accuracy:  0.9581318681318681 
Precision:  0.975978835978836 
Recall:  0.9077170977170977 
F1-measure:  0.9397389399722057
